# UDP5WA4CF-UN03_back_end_development

This website is built for my Back End Development milestone project 3 with [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net).


## Justification

Tracking of success rate for PiL course tests; possibility of teaching improvements via targetted understanding of strengths/weaknesses.

### Reflections

If an infinite `while` loop is created by accident, close Visual Studio Code and repoen it; something about being caught in an infitine loop breaks the ability to run the fixed code, despite refreshing the terminal.

`pip freeze > requirements.txt` and `pip install -r requirements.txt` is awesome functionality.

If something isn't working but the code _seems_ fine, remember to check DevTools for any JavaScript errors (or other errors)! This probably seems trivial, but today I spent most of an hour thinking everything was fine, but something was broken and couldn't see what; then I thought to check DevTools and it told me that the JavaScript wasn't being read... Which, of course, immediately led me to the problem. Small win, but good foundation.

`assert` is a cool error checking tool.

### How to...

UPDATE

View the deployed site on [GitHub](https://github.com/dashboard) Pages, [here](https://stillprocrastinating.github.io/UDP5WA4CF-UN02_interactive_front_end_development/).

This website was developed using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). The terminal was used to commit and push to [GitHub](https://github.com/dashboard).  
For a video tutorial by [The Code City](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodeCity) on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com), click [here](https://youtu.be/JB7YD7OKm5g?si=6b_75xUimYFwXsza).


#### Deployment steps

UPDATE

1. Log in to [GitHub](https://github.com/dashboard) and locate the GitHub Repository.
1. At the top of the Repository, locate the Settings button on the menu.
1. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the Pages section.
1. Under Source, click the dropdown called None and select Master/Main Branch.
1. Ensure the branch and directory/folder are saved.
1. Refresh the page until a new section appears at the top of the screen beginning "Your page is live at" and then a link. This link is the deployed/live link of your website homepage (index.html).

### Libraries

UPDATE

Inspiration for much of the code was modified directly from the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net) "Love Maths" (repo [here](https://github.com/stillprocrastinating/UDP5WA4CF-TU_love_maths)) and "Simon Game" (repo [here](https://github.com/stillprocrastinating/UDP5WA4CF-TU_simon_game)) walkthrough projects.


### Accessibility

Please find a comprehensive list of accessibility under _0_documents_ > _README_ > _files_ > _[accessibility](https://github.com/stillprocrastinating/UDP5WA4CF-UN03_back_end_development/blob/main/0_documents/README/files/accessibility.md)_.  
TLDR as follows.

UPDATE with only used colours & list `aria-label`s in accessibility.md

| Object | Ratio | WCAG AA |
|-|-|-|

### Images
_Files can be found under `0_static/images/base`._

The original [zebrafish image](https://www.istockphoto.com/vector/zebrafish-gm479692688-68004101) was designed by [designdunja](https://www.istockphoto.com/portfolio/designdunja?mediatype=illustration) and sourced from [iStock by Getty Images](https://www.istockphoto.com).

The [REAL Rating 1 - Automation image](https://www.realgoodai.org/real-rating) was sourced from [REAL Good AI](https://www.realgoodai.org). The rating indicates that my pages were assisted by AI automation (for example, automatic completion of standard code), but no idea-generation or copy-pasting from a generative AI was used.


#### Favicon

UPDATE

The [favicon](https://github.com/stillprocrastinating/UDP5WA4CF-UN01_user_centric_front_end_development/blob/main/assets/images/d%26d_logo.png) was generated from [the official D&D logo](https://www.enworld.org/resources/d-d-5e-logo-pack.1043/) using [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/).
_Files can be found under `assets/images/favicon`._


#### Icons

UPDATE

The saves area image SVGs were sourced from [Lucide](https://lucide.dev).  
_Files can be found under `assets/images/saves-area`._
- The edit image was [square-pen](https://lucide.dev/icons/square-pen).
